OpenEmu is an open source project to bring game emulation to OS X as a first
class citizen, leveraging modern OS X technologies such as Cocoa, Core
Animation and Quartz, and 3rd party libraries like Sparkle for auto-updating.
OpenEmu is based on a modular architecture, allowing for game-engine plugins,
this means OpenEmu can support a host of different emulation engines and
back-ends while retaining a familiar OS X native front-end.

Currently OpenEmu can load the following game engines as plugins:

* Atari800 - adds support for Atari 5200 
* Bliss - adds support for Intellivision 
* CrabEmu  - adds support for Sega Master System, Game Gear, SG - 1000 and ColecoVision
